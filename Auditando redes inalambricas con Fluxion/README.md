# Fluxion is the future of MITM WPA attacks
Fluxion is a security auditing and social-engineering research tool. It is a remake of linset by vk496 with (hopefully) fewer bugs and more functionality. The script attempts to retrieve the WPA/WPA2 key from a target access point by means of a social engineering (phishing) attack. It's compatible with the latest release of Kali (rolling). Fluxion's attacks' setup is mostly manual, but experimental auto-mode handles some of the attacks' setup parameters. Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion/wiki/FAQ) before requesting issues.

If you need quick help, fluxion is also available on gitter. You can talk with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/FluxionNetwork/Lobby) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G43gptk).

## :octocat: How to contribute
All contributions are welcome! Code, documentation, graphics, or even design suggestions are welcome; use GitHub to its fullest. Submit pull requests, contribute tutorials or other wiki content -- whatever you have to offer, it'll be appreciated but please follow the [style guide](https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion/wiki/Code-style-guide).

## :book: How it works
* Scan for a target wireless network.
* Launch the `Handshake Snooper` attack.
* Capture a handshake (necessary for password verification).
* Launch `Captive Portal` attack.
* Spawns a rogue (fake) AP, imitating the original access point.
* Spawns a DNS server, redirecting all requests to the attacker's host running the captive portal.
* Spawns a web server, serving the captive portal which prompts users for their WPA/WPA2 key.
* Spawns a jammer, deauthenticating all clients from original AP and luring them to the rogue AP.
* All authentication attempts at the captive portal are checked against the handshake file captured earlier.
* The attack will automatically terminate once a correct key has been submitted.
* The key will be logged and clients will be allowed to reconnect to the target access point.

* For a guide to the `Captive Portal` attack, read the [Captive Portal attack guide](https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion/wiki/Captive-Portal-Attack)
