#Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

##Guidelines for Pull Requests:

1. Respect the coding style of QuasarRAT.
2. Make a single change per commit.
3. Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.
4. PR of reformatting (changing of ws/TAB, line endings or coding style) of source code won't be accepted.

In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your pull request will get accepted.
