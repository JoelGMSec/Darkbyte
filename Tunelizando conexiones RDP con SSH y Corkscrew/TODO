Minor Tweaks :
* Some work has been done to get corkscrew to compile on old versions
  of SunOS (primarily 4.1.3).  If someone want's this I might work on
  it some more, otherwise I've damn near given up.
* The code works, but it's probably not very efficient.  Planning on
  spending some time to work on this.

Major Tweaks :
* Add support for HTTP authentication.
* Add support for WinGate proxies (uh, well... we'll see).
